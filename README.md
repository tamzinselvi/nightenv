### Create your own plugin

To create your own plugin, create a JavaScript file that exports a `execute` function, like so:

```js
module.exports.execute = function(config, isNight) {

  // config is an object that contains configuration arbitrarily
  // defined by your plugin

  // isNight is a boolean that represents whether it is night time

  // this function should return a promise with the configuration
  // containing any updates if there are any, giving your plugin
  // the ability to maintain state

};
```

## About

After many days of switching between dark and light themes to reduce eye strain, I neeed an automated solution, hence `nightenv`.  This is not meant to be a state of the art piece of software, but instead it was meant to be a quick and easy tool that could be easily extended.  Feel free to contribute new plugins or update the already existing ones if you have any issues.
